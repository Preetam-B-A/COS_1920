Objective
This problem puts your understanding of nested conditional statements to the test.

Task
Your teacher needs your help! Given the expected and actual submission of dates for lab experiments , create a program that calculates the each experiment pointer and calculate the overall grade.

The pointer structure is as follows:

If the lab experiment is submitted on the expected submission date then allocated pointer is 10
If the lab experiment is submitted after the expected submission date but still within two days of expected submission date then the allocated pointer is 6
If the lab experiment is submitted any day after the two days of expected submission date then the allocated pointer is 2
The grade structure is as follows:

The overall grade will be A when the average pointer is 10
The overall grade will be B when the average pointer is between 7 to 9
The overall grade will C when the average pointer is between 5 to 6
The overall grade will be D when all the above criteria does not satisfy.
Input Format
The first line contains an integer T (total number of lab experiments)
Each lab experiment consists of two lines.
The first line consists of E (expected submission date) space-separated integers denoting the respective day (D),month (M) and year (Y)
The second line consists of A (actual submission date) space-separated integers denoting the respective day (D),month (M) and year (Y)
Output Format
The output is O (array of two elements) where the first element is AP (average pointer) and second element is G (overall grade)

Constraints
1 <= D <= 31
1 <= M <= 12
2019 <= Y <= 2019
1 <= T <= 10
1 <= O <= 2
1 <= AP <= 10
A <= G <= D
Sample Input:
3
9 9 2019
9 9 2019
10 10 2019
11 10 2019
15 11 2019
19 11 2019
Sample Output:
6 C
