Objective
This problem puts your understanding of simple basics of programming

Task
You are provided with your academic pointer from semester 1 to semester 8. Pointers are provided between 1 to 100 both including. Your task is to first calculate the mean of all the semester pointers and then provide the factorial of the first digit of the mean value.

Details
Let's consider student X has pointer from first to eighth semester pointer P = [70,70,80,90,90,80,80,70] and the mean of all the pointer is M = 78.75. Now the factorial value of the first digit 7 of 78.75 is 5040

Input Format
The only line has eight space-separated integers describing your pointer of all 8 semester

Output Format
The first line prints the output of mean value The second line prints the output of factorial of the first digit of the mean value

Constraints
P[i] here i : 1 to 8
Sample Input:
70 70 80 90 90 80 80 70

Sample Output:
78.75 5040
